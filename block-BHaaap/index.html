                <p class="text">Hello. My name is Taya Graham, and welcome to the Police Accountability Report. As I always make clear, this show has a single purpose: holding the politically powerful institution of policing accountable. And to do so, we don’t just focus on the bad behavior of individual cops. Instead, we examine the system that makes bad policing possible. And today we’re going to achieve that goal by examining the arrest of a cop watcher and reporting on what happened when the case went to court. But we’re also going to use the case as a prism through which we can examine the different approaches and philosophies that define the movement itself.</p>
